Hey This is a simple Admin Panel which stores and manipulates the employees' data in the database. <br>This project uses Flask framework as the backend and Bootstrap and JS for on-page manipulation.<br>
The first page is simply an Admin Panel home page with inputs to enter new employees' data and a button to go to the employees' list.<br>

The second page shows the employees list where all the employees are listed and Edit/Delete operations can pe performed for each row. <br>Also the page holds multiple Filters and Sorting functions on basis of salary, name, and positions.
<br>(Only that filter will work whose Submit button is pressed)<br>
